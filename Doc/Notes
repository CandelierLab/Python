*** Test programs

Test programs are used for testing. They are not described in the documentation.

*** Examples

Examples are different from tests: it's just an architecture that allows pdoc to find the markdown files in the mirrored Doc/Files/Examples folder.

So, every example to be inserted in the documentation should have two files:
- An Examples/.../example.py that simply contains a pointer to the markdown file
- A markdown file Doc/Files/MD/Examples/.../example.md that actually contins the example description.

Examples are then refered to as `Examples.[...].example`.
